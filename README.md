# Hub City Cameras Repository
---

This repository contains projects that use live camera feeds provided by the City of Moncton

- The data used in these projects comes from open.moncton.ca
- The first sample smdCityBasic is a simple html/css/js project that displays multiple webcam feeds
- UPDATE: You can now enlarge a camera feed by clicking on it. Click again to reduce the size.
